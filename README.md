## Sudoku Solver

![sample](https://github.com/SimonCao1207/SudokuSolver/blob/master/img/sudoku_img3.png?raw=True)

Input a Sudoku board image. It solves it and gives the result. As simple as that !

## Getting started

- `main.py` : main file with path to image.
- `utils.py` : contains all helper functions
- `knn.py` : Train a knn model
- `train_cnn.ipynb` : Train a cnn model
- `cnn.py` : CNN architecture
- `run_test.py` : file to test features. 

### TODO: 

- [ ] Improve digit classifier, currently is not working properly for certain images (maybe because of preprocessing phase)

- [ ] Front end ?
